# Customer-churn-
**Customer Database Analysis to Develop a Machine Learning Model**

The goal is to create a machine learning model capable of predicting which customers are most likely to switch service providers, allowing for targeted promotional offers to retain them.

# Methods
**Decision Tree** 
- Uses demographic variables, customer behavior data, information about contracted services, and financial data.
- Predicts the likelihood of customer churning based on these features.

**Confusion Matrix**
- A fundamental metric for evaluating classification models.
- Displays the model's performance in distinguishing: True Positive (TP), False NEgative (FN), False Positive (FP), True Negative (TN)
- Crucial for understanding the balnce between correct and incorrect predictions, helping refine the model's accuracy and reliability.
